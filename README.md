# PostgreSQL 9.6 High Performance
This is the code repository for [PostgreSQL 9.6 High Performance](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/postgresql-high-performance-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781784392970), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book starts with the basic concepts of database performance, because all successful database applications are destined to eventually run into issues when scaling up their performance. Therefore, you need to understand the basics of database performance.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter05.



The code will look like the following:
```
blocks = 250,000 * (gigabytes of RAM)
```

In order for this book to be useful, you need at least access to a PostgreSQL client that is allowed to execute queries on a server. Ideally, you'll also be the server administrator. Full client and server packages for PostgreSQL are available for most popular operating systems at http://www.postgresql.org/download/. All of the examples here are executed at a command prompt, usually running the psql program. This makes them applicable to most platforms. It's straightforward to do many of these operations instead using a GUI tool for PostgreSQL, such as the pgAdmin III program.
